## Summary

I’m a father, an engineer, and a mindfulness practitioner. I want to enhance and automate testing process from requirements phase.

I have more than seven years of experience in automotive software development. It was a fortune of mine that I had a chance to work on different roles and different phases in the automotive software life cycle and successfully deliver good quality products to customer.

Currently, I am working as an automation test lead for an automotive safety project.
I have experience developing CICD systems, and automation tests framework for automotive software.

Below are skills and tools I'm familiar with:

-   Develop: Python, Jenkins, Lauterbach, cmm script, bash, Linux, Yocto, Embedded C, AUTOSAR, Makefile, linker, git, Github action, MongoDB.
-   Test: Requirement analysis, Unit test, system test, integration test, performance, fault injection, code coverage, MCDC coverage, static analysis
-   Manage: Agile Scrum, Jira, confluence, test management, ISO26262, ASPICE.

## Education

-   2012-2017: Bach khoa - Ho Chi Minh city university of technology  
     _Engineering in Electronic – Telecommunication_

## Work Experience

### FPT software

#### May 2020 - current: Automation Test Lead

-   Led and mentored a team of 5 members to successfully test and implement a testing framework for new software from EAR to RTM phase.
-   Responsible for designing and developing a testing framework for an inter-platform communication driver. There are some other frameworks in the company at that time, but none of them are suitable for some special requirements of our project. So we have to develop a new testing framework. This framework is mainly written in Python and has to adapt to some main requirements below:

    -   Build and execute tests for multiple types of RTOS, Linux, CPU architectures, and compilers.
    -   Different tests are executed per commit, nightly, or weekly.
    -   Framework can run on Windows and Linux machines.
    -   Can generate or integrate with all report generation tools needed for a release.

-   Testing framework workflow:

    -   Code commit (git) > CI tools (Jenkins) > build, run, report (python) > store result and artifacts (MongoDB, shared driver)

-   Skills included: Python, Jenkins, Lauterbach, cmm script, bash, Linux, Yocto, Embedded C, AUTOSAR, Makefile, linker, git, MongoDB
