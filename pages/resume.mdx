## Summary

I’m a father, an engineer, and a mindfulness practitioner. I want to enhance the development process through requirements to testing phase.

I have more than seven years of experience in automotive software development. I was fortunate to have the chance to work in different roles and phases of the automotive software life cycle, successfully delivering high-quality products to customers.

Currently, I am working as a test lead for an automotive safety project.
