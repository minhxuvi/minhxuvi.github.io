# I’m a father, bicycler, and engineer.

## Tell us a little bit about yourself

We don’t need much to live. Air, water, food, safe place to sleep are enough for us in terms of survival. I want to live a simple life that I can pack up everything in a bike and travel the world with it. But there are things that I don’t figure out how to pack in a bike. They are my children, they need a stable place for their childhood. So I decided to pause my dream for about 15-20 years to raise my kids. And become a host for bicyclists from all over the world, listen to their stories, and nurture my dream.  
Before knowing about Warmshowers, I also had an idea about a website only for hosts and cyclists. Then I found out about this website. It matches up with my dream so I want to contribute to Warmshowers if have a chance. At least, currently, I really want to translate the website into Vietnamese.

## Provide a short summary of your professional experience

My professional is an engineer. I worked as a project manager and Devops engineer in embedded system projects at NXP. I’m not a senior in web & app development, but I think I can contribute to the site development also. I host this website https://dapxexuyenviet.vn/ myself. I have experience in CICD, Jenkins, Python… and know basic about cloud and infrastructure as code.
