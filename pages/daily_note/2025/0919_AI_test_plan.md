Below is a **full, detailed AI Stack Test Plan** you can use as a real project document. It is structured to cover **six layers** end‑to‑end: **Hardware**, **System Software**, **Data Pipeline**, **Model**, **Application**, and **Deployment & MLOps**. It includes objectives, scope, environments, entry/exit criteria, test cases, metrics/SLOs, tooling, automation gates, risk management, defect workflow, RACI, and traceability.

If you want, I can also generate this as a **.docx or .xlsx** with tables and checklists ready to use.
