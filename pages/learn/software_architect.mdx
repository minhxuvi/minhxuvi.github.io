What the system should be deal with

-   Performance
    -   Latency - time to finish a task
    -   Throughput - number of tasks in a period of time
-   Load
-   Data volume
-   Concurrent users
-   SLA - Service Level Agreement

#### Quality

-   Scalability
-   Managebilaty
    -   System should report the problems.
-   Modularity
-   Extensibility
-   Testability

--- Never start working on a system before setting requirements ---

### Map the components

-   Web app
-   Web API
-   Mobile app
-   Desktop app
-   **Console app**
-   Services
