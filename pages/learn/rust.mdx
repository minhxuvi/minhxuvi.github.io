# Primitive types and control flow

## Scalar types

-   Underscore in numeric literals for readability. `1_000` is the same as `1000`.
-   f64 is the default type for floating-point numbers. But it slow, so f32 is used for performance.
-   IEEE-754 standard for floating-point numbers.

## Compound types

Tuple

-   Max 12 elements

Array

-   Max 32 elements

## Control flow

`if` expression

## Strings
