Offer free education on company's products and services. Paid for certification.
It's costly to jump into education system and also not very meaningful.
Because you don't want to judge people by their certificates.
You don't want to judge a person at all.
The person should learn by themselves.
But still you want a company to work on health care products.
The certification is needed but you can always hire someone else.
The crucial part is your own bussiness.
**You only need the certification when you don't have enough money.**

So you aim for the certification in medication.
But the cert in medication is too heavy to be in the survial part.
Maybe knowledge in Estern medication and public health care is better.
