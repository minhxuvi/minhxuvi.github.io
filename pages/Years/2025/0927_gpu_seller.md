## Hereâ€™s a **practical roadmap** for starting a small GPU shop in Vietnam with **50,000,000 VND (~\$2,000)**

---

### âœ… **Step 1: Understand Your Budget & Market**

- **Budget reality:** 50M VND is too small for a physical shop or stocking high-end GPUs (new RTX 4000+ cards cost 20â€“70M VND each)[1](https://thegioimaychu.vn/linh-kien-may-chu/gpu-card-may-chu).
- **Market trend:** Vietnamâ€™s gaming hardware market is growing fast (CAGR ~9%, projected \$1.43B by 2030), driven by young gamers and content creators[2](https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/media/games/gaming-hardware/vietnam).
- **Opportunity:** Focus on **budget GPUs**, **used/refurbished cards**, or **GPU rental/cloud services**. Demand for affordable GPUs is rising due to AI and gaming[3](https://www.accio.com/business/gpu_price_trends).

---

### âœ… **Step 2: Choose Your Business Model**

With 50M VND, you canâ€™t stock many new GPUs, so consider:

1. **Online Reseller (Low Risk)**
   - Buy **used GPUs** from trusted sources (Facebook groups, Chá»£ Tá»‘t, Shopee) and resell with a small margin.
   - Platforms: **Shopee, Lazada, Chá»£ Tá»‘t, Facebook Marketplace**[4](https://vietnamteachingjobs.com/blog/vietnam-online-marketplace/).
2. **GPU Rental / AI Compute Service**
   - Rent GPUs for gaming or AI workloads by the hour (using your own PC or a small rig).
   - Target: Students, freelancers, small AI projects.
3. **Drop-shipping or Pre-order Model**
   - Partner with suppliers (e.g., GearVN, An PhÃ¡t, Hacom) and sell on-demand without holding inventory[5](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/vietnam/computers-electronics-and-technology/computer-hardware/).

---

### âœ… **Step 3: Legal & Setup**

- **Register as a household business (Há»™ kinh doanh)** â€“ simplest form for small traders.
- **Tax:** 10% VAT on imports; import duty varies (usually 0â€“10% for electronics)[6](https://fnm-vietnam.com/import-export/vietnam-import-tax-duties/).
- **If importing:** You need an import license and comply with customs rules[7](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/vietnam-import-requirements-and-documentation).

---

### âœ… **Step 4: Sourcing GPUs**

- **Local sources:** Facebook groups, Chá»£ Tá»‘t, GearVN, Hacom, PhÃºc Anh.
- **Used GPU caution:** Test for mining history, overheating, and warranty.
- **Budget example:** With 50M VND, you can buy:
  - 2â€“3 used RTX 3060 (~6â€“7M each) or
  - 1 new RTX 4060 (~9â€“10M) + accessories.

---

### âœ… **Step 5: Marketing & Sales**

- **Start online:** Facebook, TikTok, Shopee, Lazada.
- **Content strategy:** Post GPU benchmarks, gaming builds, and repair tips.
- **Trust factor:** Offer short warranty (7â€“30 days) for used cards.

---

### âœ… **Step 6: Scale Up**

- Reinvest profits to expand inventory.
- Add services: PC building, GPU cleaning, thermal paste replacement.
- Later, consider **physical shop** or **cloud GPU service**.
