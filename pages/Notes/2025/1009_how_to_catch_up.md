# How to catch up with develop country

You need to keep up with the latest update of platforms companies. Focus on AI. Then leverage AI to build your own tools.
The only dependency is AI infrastructure, but it's cheap. Start reinvent the wheel along with teaching at nhathuannhien.
But nhathuannhien is it's own, you learn from it, contribute to it, but build your own system for your family.
Your time is limited, so focus key areas:

- Learn Particle physics
- Learn AI
- Raising kids and building community, using AI as a tool, physic as foundation.
- Gerontology, biogerontology, longevity, anti-aging.

There are two types of learning: continuous and block learning.
Continuous learning is like language, math, music, movement, foreign languages.
Block learning is like history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, geology, handwork.
You need to learn both, but focus on block learning. Because continuous learning is more about practice, and you can practice later.
Block learning is more about understanding.
Your continuous learning:

- Develop with AI
- Morning exercise

Your learning routine should be in the early morning.
