## 1) What we‚Äôll build (scope & positioning)

**Product scope (baseline):**

- **Industrial AC induction motors (IE3/IE4)**, 0.37‚Äì7.5 kW ‚Üí broad industrial/HVAC demand.
- **PMSM traction motors** for e‚Äëtwo‚Äëwheelers/light EV subsystems ‚Üí aligns with Vietnam‚Äôs EV policy trajectory.
  *(Capacity can shift between the two families as orders evolve.)*
  *Rationale:* Vietnam is pushing hard on electrification and ‚Äúgreen transport‚Äù through 2050, which supports localized motor and EV component production and investment incentives[1](blob:https://outlook.office.com/70bb7da6-d9bd-48e0-8574-66589cfcda04).

**Scale & mix (base case used in the model):**

- **Annual nameplate capacity**: 170,000 units at steady state
  ‚Äì 120,000 Industrial AC motors
  ‚Äì 50,000 PMSM traction motors
- **Factory footprint**: ~**10,000 m¬≤** in an **Industrial Zone** (RBF‚ÄîReady‚ÄëBuilt Factory lease) to accelerate time‚Äëto‚Äëmarket and licensing; 375+ zones offer turnkey utilities and tax incentives with simplified permitting administration.

**Automation first principles (designing for OEE, yield & traceability):**

- **Automated coil winding** (needle/flyer), **VPI/oven curing**, robotized **stator/rotor sub‚Äëassembly**, magnet insertion, dynamic balancing, and **EOL test rigs** with barcode/laser marking and **vision QA**.
- **Smart intralogistics** using **AGVs/AMRs**, conveyors, automated storage, and torque tool control.
- **MES/MOM + SCADA** for real‚Äëtime SPC, genealogy/traceability, and electronic work instructions.
*(This configuration reflects mainstream best practices highlighted in electric motor plant playbooks and vendor studies.)*

## 2) Where to locate (site strategy)

**Shortlist‚Äînorthern & southern corridors:**

- **North**: **Bac Ninh** / **Hai Phong**‚Äîelectronics cluster, proximity to China supply chains.
- **South**: **Binh Duong** / **Long An**‚Äîexport logistics, ports and developer‚Äërun RBF stock.
Industrial zones typically offer **CIT holidays/reductions**, **ready utilities**, and ‚Äúsingle‚Äëwindow‚Äù admin, reducing lead time for permits and construction fit‚Äëout.

**Lease vs. build:**
Start with an **RBF lease** to cut schedule risk (and start trial builds earlier). You can migrate to a built‚Äëto‚Äësuit or expand within the same park as volumes ramp. Market guidance shows **RBFs** reduce initial CAPEX and speed licensing; land/build cost vs. rent trade‚Äëoffs are detailed by leading park operators and advisors.

---

## 3) Licenses, permits & compliance (Vietnam specifics)

- **Company setup & project licensing:**
  1) **Investment Registration Certificate (IRC)** ‚Üí approves project scope & capital;
  2) **Enterprise Registration Certificate (ERC)** ‚Üí company legal establishment;
  3) **Construction/fit‚Äëout**, **fire safety**, and **environmental** clearances (park developers often pre‚Äëhold some approvals).

- **Environmental regime (current):**
  ‚Äì Vietnam consolidated permits under the **Law on Environmental Protection 2020**; projects require a single **Environmental Permit** (and **EIA** for medium/large‚Äëscale) with emissions, wastewater, noise, and hazardous waste controls spelled out. Recent **Decree 05/2025** changes **who reviews** (more to provincial People‚Äôs Committees), clarifies **when to renew/reissue** permits, and **limits scrap imports** to 80% of feedstock‚Äîimportant for copper/steel strategy.

- **EV/green incentives trend:**
  Vietnam is rolling out EV strategies, tax preferences, and proposed subsidies for EV adoption. Projects aligned to **green/advanced manufacturing** can qualify for **reduced CIT rates**, holidays, and **import duty exemptions** on machinery and inputs (subject to eligibility and location)[1](blob:https://outlook.office.com/70bb7da6-d9bd-48e0-8574-66589cfcda04).

*(CAPEX structure and unit ops align with published electric motor plant project guides.)*

### OPEX snapshot (steady state, Year 3)

- **RBF lease** (~10,000 m¬≤ @ $5/m¬≤/mo, escalator 3%): ‚âà **$0.62M/yr**
- **Headcount**: ~**150 FTE** (automation technicians/ME/quality)
- **Maintenance**: ~**3%** of equipment value
- Utilities, SG&A, and working capital reserves modeled explicitly in the workbook.
*(RBF approach and cost dimensions are consistent with Vietnam industrial park operator guidance.)*

### Revenue & margins (base case)

- **Volumes**: 170k units/year at full run (Year 3 onward)
- **Average selling price (Y1)**: Industrial AC **$160**, PMSM **$420** (with 1%/yr price erosion)
- **BOM (Y1)**: Industrial **$95**, PMSM **$260** (with 2%/yr inflation)
- **Year‚Äë3 revenue** ‚âà **$39‚Äì40M**; **gross margin ~30‚Äì32%** before SG&A (see model details)
*(Pricing/process cost bands align with industry project report norms‚Äîactuals depend on motor families/specs.)*

### Taxes & incentives (modeled)

- **Tax holiday (0% CIT) for first 4 years**, then **10% CIT** for next 9 years **if eligible** (green/high‚Äëtech/priority + location).
- Separate case modeled at **standard 20% CIT** (no incentives).
*(Structure reflects common incentive patterns and legal commentary‚Äîfinal eligibility depends on actual project classification and zone.)*[1](blob:https://outlook.office.com/70bb7da6-d9bd-48e0-8574-66589cfcda04)

### Investment & returns (10‚Äëyear model; WACC 12%)

- **Total initial investment (CAPEX)**: **$28.82M**
- **IRR (with incentives)**: **~8.8%**; **NPV** @12%: **‚Äì$3.19M**
- **IRR (without incentives)**: **~7.0%**; **NPV** @12%: **‚Äì$5.01M**
- **Sensitivity (see ‚ÄúSensitivity‚Äù tab in the Excel)**:
  - **ASP +10%** ‚Üí materially higher IRR
  - **BOM ‚Äì10%** (e.g., magnet/copper localization) ‚Üí higher IRR
  - **Volume +20%** ‚Üí higher IRR
  - **ASP +5% & Volume +20%** ‚Üí approaching mid‚Äëteens IRR
**Interpretation:** In a fully automated configuration at this scale, **returns hinge on mix/ASP, localization of magnets/copper, and volume**. Incentives and selecting a zone with stronger CIT packages also matter.
*(All calculations are in the workbook; plant economics & incentive logic based on Vietnamese legal/market sources.)*[1](blob:https://outlook.office.com/70bb7da6-d9bd-48e0-8574-66589cfcda04)

## 7) Risk & mitigation

- **Rare‚Äëearth & copper volatility** ‚Üí multi‚Äëyear supply contracts; dual‚Äësource NdFeB; explore **magnet recycling**; incremental **localization** as Decree 05/2025 caps imported scrap to 80% of needs (balance domestically).
- **Permitting/EIA delays** ‚Üí choose **mature industrial parks**; start **EIA** early; align layouts with **wastewater/emissions** targets under LEP 2020; provincial People‚Äôs Committees now hold more review power, which can speed timelines when engaged early.
- **Demand ramp risk** ‚Üí modular lines, convertible tooling; phased hiring; secure initial **anchor customers** (industrial/HVAC and 2W OEMs).
- **Quality/recalls** ‚Üí **IATF 16949** roadmap if supplying automotive; strong EOL and traceability.
- **Power quality** ‚Üí harmonic filters, backup gensets/UPS for automation.

## 10) How I can tailor this for you

I can quickly adjust the model and layout for your exact vision:

- **Product focus**: purely **industrial AC**, purely **PMSM traction**, or a different mix?
- **Capacity** target (units/yr) and **footprint** (m¬≤)?
- **In‚Äëhouse vs. outsource**: lamination stamping, magnet machining, varnish impregnation, etc.?
- **Location** preference (north vs. south, specific industrial park) to reflect **local lease & incentive** terms?

If you share those preferences, I‚Äôll **update the financial model**, add a **Gantt plan**, and provide a **vendor shortlist** (equipment/MES/park developers) aligned to your choices.
