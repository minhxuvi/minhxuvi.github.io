## âœ… Section 2: Gen AI & AI Tools

### **Topic Goals**

- Assess understanding of Generative AI concepts, LLM testing, and AI toolchains.
- Evaluate ability to design QA strategies for AI systems.
- Check familiarity with benchmarking, prompt engineering, and model evaluation.

---

### **Q1. What is Generative AI, and how is it different from traditional AI?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Generative AI** creates new content (text, images, code) using models like GPT, Stable Diffusion.
- **Traditional AI** focuses on classification, prediction, or decision-making based on existing data.
- Key difference: Generative AI learns **data distribution** and generates novel outputs.

---

### **Q2. Explain the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs).**

**Sample Answer:**

- LLMs are deep learning models trained on massive text corpora to predict the next token in a sequence.
- Examples: GPT, LLaMA, Claude.
- Key features: **Transformer architecture**, **attention mechanism**, **scaling laws**.

---

### **Q3. How do you test an LLM-based application?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Functional Testing**: Validate prompt â†’ response correctness.
- **Robustness Testing**: Test adversarial prompts, edge cases.
- **Bias & Fairness Testing**: Check for harmful or biased outputs.
- **Performance Testing**: Latency, throughput under load.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, human evaluation.

---

### **Q4. What is prompt engineering, and why is it important?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Prompt engineering** is crafting input prompts to guide model behavior.
- Important because LLMs are **context-sensitive**; small changes in prompts can drastically affect output.
- Techniques: **Few-shot**, **Chain-of-Thought**, **Role prompting**.

---

### **Q5. How do you benchmark an AI model?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Use **standard datasets** (e.g., GLUE, MMLU for NLP).
- Metrics: **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, **BLEU**, **Latency**, **Memory footprint**.
- Compare against **baseline models** and **SOTA benchmarks**.

---

### **Q6. What are common failure modes of LLMs?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Hallucination**: Fabricating facts.
- **Prompt sensitivity**: Output changes drastically with minor prompt changes.
- **Bias & Toxicity**: Producing harmful content.
- **Context window limits**: Forgetting earlier context in long conversations.

---

### **Q7. How do you ensure reproducibility in AI experiments?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Fix **random seeds**.
- Log **hyperparameters**, **model versions**, **dataset versions**.
- Use tools like **MLflow**, **Weights & Biases**.
- Containerize environment with **Docker**.

---

### **Q8. Explain the difference between fine-tuning and prompt-tuning.**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Fine-tuning**: Retraining model weights on domain-specific data.
- **Prompt-tuning**: Adding small trainable parameters (soft prompts) without changing core weights.
- Prompt-tuning is **lighter** and **faster**.

---

### **Q9. Scenario: Your AI model gives inconsistent answers for the same question. How do you debug?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Check **temperature** parameter (controls randomness).
- Ensure **deterministic settings** (seed, sampling).
- Analyze **prompt ambiguity**.
- Validate **model version** and **deployment consistency**.

---

### **Q10. Scenario: You need to test an AI chatbot for safety. Whatâ€™s your approach?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Create **adversarial prompts** (jailbreak attempts).
- Test for **harmful content**, **bias**, **privacy leaks**.
- Use **red-teaming** and **toxicity detection tools** (Perspective API).
- Implement **guardrails** (e.g., moderation filters).

---

### **Q11. Which tools or frameworks would you use for LLM evaluation?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **OpenAI Evals**, **LangChain Benchmarks**, **EleutherAI Harness**.
- For metrics: **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, **BERTScore**.
- For human eval: **Crowdsourcing platforms** (MTurk).

---

### **Q12. How would you integrate AI testing into a CI/CD pipeline?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Containerize model and test scripts with **Docker**.
- Use **pytest** for functional tests.
- Automate **model performance checks** (latency, accuracy) in CI.
- Deploy with **Kubernetes** for scalability.
