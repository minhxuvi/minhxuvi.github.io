Here’s **Section 4: General / Problem Solving** for the demo interview.
This section is designed for **~1 hour** with **12 questions** (logical reasoning, debugging, and real-world QA challenges). Each question includes **detailed sample answers**.

---

## ✅ Section 4: General / Problem Solving

### **Topic Goals**

- Assess analytical thinking and structured problem-solving.
- Evaluate ability to debug complex issues.
- Test communication and prioritization skills.

---

### **Q1. How do you approach a critical production bug reported by a customer?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Acknowledge & Communicate**: Inform stakeholders immediately.
- **Reproduce**: Try to replicate the issue in-house.
- **Analyze Logs**: Collect logs, system metrics.
- **Isolate Root Cause**: Narrow down components.
- **Workaround**: Provide temporary fix if possible.
- **Permanent Fix**: Collaborate with dev team.
- **Postmortem**: Document and prevent recurrence.

---

### **Q2. How do you prioritize tasks when everything seems urgent?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Use **Impact vs. Urgency Matrix**.
- Focus on **business-critical features** first.
- Communicate trade-offs with stakeholders.
- Example: Fixing a crash bug > UI alignment issue.

---

### **Q3. How do you estimate testing effort for a new feature?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Break down feature into **testable components**.
- Estimate based on:
  - **Complexity**
  - **Dependencies**
  - **Test types** (manual, automation)
- Add **buffer for unknowns**.
- Use historical data for accuracy.

---

### **Q4. How do you handle a situation where developers disagree with your bug report?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Provide **clear reproduction steps**.
- Attach **logs, screenshots, videos**.
- Reference **requirements/specifications**.
- If still disputed, escalate to **product owner**.

---

### **Q5. How do you debug an intermittent test failure?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Collect **failure logs** across runs.
- Check for **timing issues** (add waits).
- Validate **environment stability**.
- Use **retry mechanism** for flaky tests.
- If reproducible, isolate root cause.

---

### **Q6. Logical Puzzle: You have 8 balls, one is heavier. How do you find it in 2 weighings?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Split into 3 groups: 3, 3, 2.
- Weigh first two groups (3 vs 3):
  - If equal → heavier ball in group of 2 → weigh them.
  - If not equal → heavier group → weigh 2 balls from it.

---

### **Q7. Scenario: Your CI pipeline takes 2 hours to run. How do you optimize it?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Parallelize tests** (pytest-xdist).
- **Run smoke tests first**.
- **Cache dependencies**.
- Use **incremental builds**.
- Move heavy tests to **nightly runs**.

---

### **Q8. Scenario: You need to test a feature with incomplete requirements. What do you do?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Clarify with **product owner**.
- Use **exploratory testing** to identify gaps.
- Document assumptions and share with team.
- Update test cases once requirements are finalized.

---

### **Q9. How do you measure QA effectiveness?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Defect Leakage Rate** (bugs found after release).
- **Test Coverage** (requirements vs. tests).
- **Automation Coverage**.
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** and **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**.

---

### **Q10. How do you ensure quality in an Agile environment?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Participate in **sprint planning** and **daily stand-ups**.
- Write **acceptance criteria** with devs and POs.
- Shift-left testing: **unit tests**, **API tests** early.
- Continuous feedback via **CI/CD**.

---

### **Q11. Scenario: You find a critical bug just before release. What do you do?**

**Sample Answer:**

- **Stop the release** and inform stakeholders.
- Provide **impact analysis**.
- Suggest **workaround** if possible.
- Document and prioritize fix for next build.

---

### **Q12. How do you keep yourself updated with new QA tools and technologies?**

**Sample Answer:**

- Follow **QA communities** (Ministry of Testing, Reddit QA).
- Attend **conferences/webinars**.
- Experiment with **open-source tools**.
- Take **online courses** (Coursera, Udemy).

---

✅ **Time Allocation:**

- General QA & Communication (Q1–Q5): ~20 mins
- Logical Puzzle & Scenarios (Q6–Q8): ~20 mins
- Metrics & Agile (Q9–Q12): ~20 mins

### ✅ Next Step: Salary Negotiation Script

I’ll now prepare a **salary negotiation scenario** based on NVIDIA’s Senior QA Test Development Engineer role and the candidate’s experience.

Do you want me to:
**A)** Provide a **realistic salary range for NVIDIA in Vietnam (or APAC)** and a **negotiation dialogue**,
or
**B)** Create a **role-play script** where the interviewer and candidate negotiate salary?
