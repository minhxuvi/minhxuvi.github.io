# Game Recommendations for Child Development (0–15 years)

Absolutely, Minh! I’ve added a **“Skills Developed”** column and kept **Go, Chess, and other strategy games** in the later years.

### 🧠 Games & Activities for Cognitive Development (0–15 years)

| Age Range | Key Focus Areas | Example Games & Activities | Skills Developed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0–6 months** | Sensory exploration, bonding | Peek‑a‑boo, rattles, high‑contrast cards, tummy time, gentle music | Visual tracking, auditory processing, bonding/attachment, neck/trunk strength, early attention |
| **6–12 months** | Object permanence, cause–effect | Stacking cups, drop‑and‑retrieve, hide‑the‑toy, soft blocks, simple rhythm play | Object permanence, hand‑eye coordination, cause–effect reasoning, turn‑taking foundations |
| **12–18 months** | Problem‑solving, imitation | Shape sorters, push‑pull toys, simple pretend phone calls, large‑knob puzzles | Problem solving, imitation, fine motor precision, early symbolic play, language foundations |
| **18–24 months** | Memory, early pretend play | 2–4 piece puzzles, matching picture cards, pretend cooking/feeding dolls, fill‑and‑pour water play | Working memory, attention span, sequencing, vocabulary growth, bilateral coordination |
| **2–3 years** | Language burst, symbolic thinking | Role play (doctor/shop), block towers, “What’s missing?” tray games, simple scavenger hunts | Expressive/receptive language, categorization, planning, inhibitory control (waiting turns) |
| **3–4 years** | Imagination, early logic | Storytelling with puppets, beginner board games (roll‑and‑move), sorting by color/size, obstacle courses | Narrative thinking, early numeracy, flexible thinking, gross/fine motor integration |
| **4–5 years** | Pre‑math, planning, creativity | Pattern blocks, treasure hunts with picture clues, LEGO builds from picture prompts | Pattern recognition, visual‑spatial reasoning, planning, perseverance, collaboration |
| **5–6 years** | Rules, cooperation, early strategy | Cooperative board games (e.g., Outfoxed), memory games, simple science experiments | Rule following, turn‑taking, working memory, observation, hypothesis testing |
| **6–7 years** | Reading readiness, sequencing | Word/picture puzzles, step‑by‑step crafts, beginner coding apps (no-text blocks), tangrams | Phonological awareness, sequencing, problem decomposition, spatial visualization |
| **7–8 years** | Logical reasoning, teamwork | **Chess (basics)**, **Go (intro on 9×9)**, LEGO robotics, cooperative strategy games (e.g., Pandemic Jr.) | Planning 1–2 moves ahead, pattern/shape reading (Go), collaboration, error checking |
| **8–9 years** | Problem‑solving, creativity | DIY maker crafts, Sudoku (easy), marble runs, logic grid puzzles | Deductive reasoning, persistence, fine motor planning, systems thinking |
| **9–10 years** | Critical thinking, planning | **Chess (intermediate)**, **Go (beginner 13×13)**, Checkers, Othello/Reversi, escape‑room puzzles | Multi‑step planning, foresight, evaluation of options, visual‑spatial strategy |
| **10–11 years** | Abstract thinking, research | Science kits, debate games, Minecraft Creative (redstone builds), **Go (intermediate)** | Abstraction, research & presentation, design thinking, conditional logic |
| **11–12 years** | Advanced logic, collaboration | Robotics kits, math riddles, **Chess club/tournaments**, team problem‑solving challenges | Strategic planning, probability & trade‑offs, teamwork/communication, resilience |
| **12–13 years** | Strategic thinking, innovation | **Risk**, **Settlers of Catan**, Carcassonne, coding challenges/hack nights (mentor‑led) | Resource management, negotiation, long‑term planning, algorithmic thinking |
| **13–14 years** | Analytical thinking, complex problem‑solving | DIY electronics/Arduino, advanced logic puzzles, simulations (city/transport planners) | Systems analysis, hypothesis testing, cost‑benefit analysis, project management |
| **14–15 years** | Complex reasoning, leadership | **Go (19×19) & Chess mastery**, debate clubs, entrepreneurship games, design sprints | Long‑horizon strategy, metacognition, leadership & facilitation, decision‑making under uncertainty |

If you’d like, I can turn this into a **printable one‑page chart** or a **detailed PDF** with short instructions and “how to level up” tips for each activity.

Do you want me to tailor a **weekly plan** for your **22‑month‑old** using items from the 18–24 months and 2–3 years rows?
