# 🧭 **6-Month Learning Roadmap (with Big Bang → Dark Energy included)**

## **📘 Month 1–2: Build the Foundation**

* Learn basic **math and physics** skills.
  🧠 *Focus:* algebra, calculus, waves, Newton’s laws.
  📚 *Courses:*

  * *Khan Academy – High School Physics*
  * *Coursera – Introduction to Mechanics (Rice University)*

---

## **🌌 Month 3: From the Big Bang to Dark Energy**

* **Take this course now.**
  🎓 *Provider:* University of Tokyo (Prof. Hitoshi Murayama)
  🎯 *Why now:* It connects what you’ve learned in classical physics to the **cosmic scale** and introduces ideas like relativity, quantum fields, and energy in space.
  🧩 *Outcome:* You’ll understand how quantum mechanics and cosmology fit together — preparing you for deeper quantum concepts.

---

## **⚛️ Month 4–5: Quantum Foundations**

* Dive into the **core of quantum mechanics.**
  📚 *Courses:*

  * *Exploring Quantum Physics – University of Maryland*
  * *Quantum Mechanics for Everyone – Georgetown University*
    🧠 *Topics:* wave–particle duality, uncertainty principle, Schrödinger equation.

---

## **💻 Month 6: Modern Quantum Applications**

* Move toward **real-world applications**.
  📚 *Courses:*

  * *Quantum Computing Fundamentals – MITx*
  * *Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation – UC Berkeley*
    🌟 *Focus:* how quantum theory drives computing, materials, and cosmology.

---

By the end of this roadmap, you’ll have both **conceptual understanding** (cosmology + physics of the universe) and **mathematical tools** to study quantum systems seriously.
