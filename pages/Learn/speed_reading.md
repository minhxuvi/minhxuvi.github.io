# Speed Reading for Technical and Scientific Material

## Core Techniques

**1. Eliminate Subvocalization (Gradually)**
Most readers "hear" words internally, which limits reading speed to about **250 wpm**. To reduce this:

* Occasionally read **slightly faster** than you can pronounce words.
* Focus on **meaning** rather than sound.
* Use background instrumental music or a metronome to distract your inner voice if helpful.

> ⚠️ Don’t eliminate subvocalization entirely for technical reading — it can aid comprehension of new or abstract terms.

**2. Use a Pacer**
Guide your eyes with a **finger, pen, or cursor**. This improves concentration and prevents regression (unnecessary re-reading).

* Start at your natural pace.
* Each day, increase speed slightly while maintaining comprehension.
* Digital readers can use tools like **Spreeder** or **BeeLine Reader** to assist pacing visually.

**3. Expand Your Eye Span**
Train to capture **3–5 words per fixation** instead of reading word-by-word.

* Practice with text columns (like newspapers or narrow margins).
* Focus your gaze on the center of a phrase; rely on **peripheral vision** for the edges.
* Use practice drills such as **Schultz tables** or **chunked text reading**.

## For Technical/Scientific Reading

**Preview strategically**
Before diving in:

* Scan **title, abstract, intro, conclusion, headings, and figures**.
* Ask: *What is this paper trying to answer? How does it do it?*
  This primes your mental model and reduces cognitive load during detailed reading.

**Adjust speed by section**

* **Slow down** for formulas, methods, or theoretical explanations.
* **Speed up** on known background or literature reviews.
* **Skim** for structure, not details, when the section’s goal is descriptive.

**Integrate comprehension strategies**

* After each section, **summarize in 1–2 sentences** (mentally or in notes).
* Write **3 key takeaways** after reading the whole paper.
* Teach or explain the concept aloud — “Feynman technique” for retention.

**Build domain fluency**

* Maintain a personal **glossary** of domain-specific terms.
* Revisit similar papers to reinforce conceptual patterns.
* Familiarity with technical jargon directly boosts effective speed.

## Practical Exercise Plan

**Week 1–2**

* Read using a pacer at normal speed.
* Track comprehension by summarizing after each paragraph/page.

**Week 3–4**

* Increase speed ~20%.
* Measure comprehension by answering short self-made questions (e.g., “What was the main finding?”).
* Accept minor dips — your brain adapts.

**Week 5+**

* Apply **layered reading**:

  1. Skim entire paper (structure and main ideas).
  2. Re-read key sections deeply.
  3. Summarize or map the logic flow.
* Use this two-layer approach for research papers, technical specs, or AI model docs.

## What Speed to Aim For

| Reader Type                | Speed           | Notes                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Average reader             | 200–250 wpm     | Comfortable but slow for research                          |
| Efficient technical reader | **300–400 wpm** | Optimal blend of speed and comprehension                   |
| Speed reader               | 500–800 wpm     | Useful for narrative content, not ideal for dense material |

🎯 **Target:** 300–400 wpm with ≥80% comprehension.
Quality of understanding > raw speed.
