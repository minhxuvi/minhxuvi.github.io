# Agentic AI

## Introduction

- Discipline in development process
- Evaluate and Error analysis
- Can use Agentic AI to build Agentic AI to build a website teach people how to build Agentic AI.
- Parallelism and modularization
- Text asset only is more reliable
- Multi-modal like sound, vision is less reliable but can be more beneficial. (ChatGPT Agent Mode)
- Break down human workflow into smaller tasks.
- End-to-end testing and component testing.
- Use LLM to judge.
- Design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, multi-agent collaboration.
- Reflection: ask LLM to evaluate its own work.
- Multi-agentic collaboration: different agents with different roles.

## Reflection Design Pattern

- Reflection with external feedback is more reliable.
- Objective evals: code-based, dataset
- Subjective evals: LLM as a judge, rubric-based
- Run in Docker sandbox

## Tools

- Functions
- MCP

## Practical tips

- End to end testing
- Component testing
- Use spreadsheet to trace and do error analysis.
- Play with model often
- Use different models
- Read prompt regularly
- Measure cost and latency
- High quality first, optimize later

## Patterns for Highly Autonomous Agents

- Create a plan first then execute
- Applied in coding agents
- We don't know the process ahead until runtime
- Plan step output to json or xml
- Plan step output can be code for execution
- Multi-agent can be linear or to have a manager agent
- Pipeline can be a python script
- Deeper hierarchy vs all-to-all communication
